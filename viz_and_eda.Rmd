# GGPLT- grammar of graphics. Organize data set into a data fram and organize plot froms the variables in the data frame. Basic graph components should have datset, asethetic mappings, geoms.
# Advanced graph components- facets, scales, statistics.
# A graph is built by combining these components. Components are consistent across graph types- scatterplots, bar graphs, density plots, ridges plots etc
```{r setup, include=FALSE}

## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
